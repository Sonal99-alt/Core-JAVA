interpreter is slow because it interprets one by one instructions inside
bytecode.

JIT compiler is faster becuase it converts a block of code from your bytecode into native code.

JIT compiler requires cache memory in order to store converted code and for the first time at least JIT compiler takes some time to convert the bytecode.

interpreter does not require any cache memory to store the converted code.
