parent  =  child    // it is allowed by default-  upcasting

child	    parent
Dac_Dbda ob=ref;    // not allowed by default

here you need to convert "ref" into "ob" i.e. parent class reference into child class reference. and this is known as "downcasting"

so above statement can be written as

Dac_Dbda ob=(Dac_Dbda) ref;  // downcasting

So when do you use Downcasting?

when we want to invoke child class method , which is not there in the parent class and we have parent class reference in the program , we have to downcast.
