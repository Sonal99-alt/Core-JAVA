				Animal

					void makeSound()
					
override "makeSound()" in all the child classes.

		Dog		Cat		Tiger
							void hunting()



write a class "AnimalDemo" with main and perform functions

	perform function should be defined in such a way that it can accept any animal and invoke "makeSound()" function.

	also make sure if "Tiger" is passed , its "hunting()" method also should be called.
