                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Aggregation is a specialize form of Association where all objects have their own lifecycle but there is ownership and child object cannot belong to another parent object. Let’s take an example of Department and teacher. A single teacher cannot belong to multiple departments, but if we delete the department teacher object will not destroy. Composition is again specialize form of Aggregation and we can call this as a “death” relationship. It is a strong type of Aggregation. Child object does not have its lifecycle and if parent object dies all child object will also be deleted. Let’s take again an example of relationship between House and rooms. House can contain multiple rooms there is no independent life of room and any room cannot belongs to two different house if we delete the house room will automatically delete. Let’s take another example relationship between Questions and options. Single questions can have multiple options and option can not belong to multiple questions. If we delete questions options will automatically delete.
