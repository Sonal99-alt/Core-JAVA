That is, with inheritance, the parent class implementation is often visible to the subclasses. Composition Advantages:black-box reuse as it does not break encapsulation. “Car” knows only an interface “Engine”. It doesn’t know the implementation.Loose coupling, program to interface. During runtime any implementations (such as “HondaEngine” ,”MarutiEngine” or “BMWEngine” can be passed to “Engine ref” and “on()” method can be invoked polymorphically.
